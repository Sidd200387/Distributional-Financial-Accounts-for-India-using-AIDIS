# Distributional-Financial-Accounts-for-India-using-AIDIS
In this project, we aim to construct the DFAs the India using AIDIS surveys-1992, 2003, 2013, and 2019. I have taken a lot of Insipiration from the following paper: "Introducing the Distributional Financial Accounts of the United States (2019)" by Batty et al.

You can download all required datasets from the Mospi website. This project was a part of my Internship at RBI in 2025.

These are some of the main code files, and further analysis can be done as required.
